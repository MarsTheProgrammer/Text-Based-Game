# Text-Based-Game
Simple text based game in C# that allows player to fight random enemy from an array. The player can heal, attack, or run. Exp is based on damage done. 
Enemies randomly drop health potions that will allow the player to heal.
The player has a simple leveling system that allows for the enemies health to increase but stay random. 
As the player's level increases, the potion drop rate decreases.

There is a hidden easter egg if the player asked for potions too many times. Not all easter eggs are good.
